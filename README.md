# Postman Minis
Postman Minis is repository that shows how to use our REST API in small bite-sized collections.

This should be considered a living repository so is always a work-in-progress.

### Variables

While collections may have specific variables that are unique to them, we do use some common ones across all collections.
Below is a table of required Global Variables to work with any collection in this repository.

| Variable   | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| baseUrl    | URL of the Axonius server you would like to use.      |
| api-key    | API key of the Axonius user you would like to use.    |
| api-secret | API secret of the Axonius user you would like to use. |
